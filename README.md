This repository includes code to utilize and compete against FiveThirtyEight's Elo model.

The original model was based on pythagorean win theorem with some advanced calculations and adjustments thrown in. More recent models use a mix of pythagorean win theorem, elo, and a "win chart" based on historical results of teams with similar records. Additionally the model now includes spread predictions for games and both win percentage and spread predictions if a team is missing their starting quarterback.

Version 2.0 Updates: Updated for 2018 season, added ability to predict future games for rest of season, NFL winning and losing score distributions studied and used for additional spread prediction.

Version 2.1 Development: Machine learning, game score predictions, Monte Carlo simulations of remaining season, and logic for playoff predictions under development.
