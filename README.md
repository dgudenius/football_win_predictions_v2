This repository includes code to utilize and compete against FiveThirtyEight's Elo model.

The original model was based on pythagorean win theorem with some advanced calculations and adjustments thrown in. More recent models use a mix of pythagorean win theorem, elo, and a "win chart" based on historical results of teams with similar records. Additionally the model now includes spread predictions for games and both win percentage and spread predictions if a team is missing their starting quarterback.
